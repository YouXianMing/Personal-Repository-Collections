A curated list of awesome iOS frameworks, libraries, tutorials, plugins Xcode, components and much more.
The list is divided into categories such as Frameworks, Components, Testing and others,  open source projects, free and paid services. There is no pre-established order of items in each category, the order is for contribution. If you want to contribute, please read the [guide](https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Projects in Swift language will be marked with :large_orange_diamond: and :watch: for Apple Watch projects. Feel free to add your project.


> ### [Shimmer](https://github.com/facebook/Shimmer)

Shimmer is an easy way to add a shimmering effect to any view in your app. It's useful as an unobtrusive loading indicator.

Shimmer was originally developed to show loading status in [Paper](http://facebook.com/paper).

![pop](https://github.com/facebook/pop/blob/master/Images/pop.gif?raw=true)

Pop is an extensible animation engine for iOS, tvOS, and OS X. In addition to basic static animations, it supports spring and decay dynamic animations, making it useful for building realistic, physics-based interactions. The API allows quick integration with existing Objective-C codebases and enables the animation of any property on any object. It's a mature and well-tested framework that drives all the animations and transitions in [Paper](http://www.facebook.com/paper).


> ### [ASMediaFocusManager](https://github.com/autresphere/ASMediaFocusManager)

ASMediaFocusManager gives the ability to focus on any thumbnail image or video by a simple tap. The thumbnail image is automatically animated to a focused fullscreen image view or video player. Another tap on the 'Done' button shrinks (or defocuses) the image back to its initial position.

Each thumbnail image view may have its own transform, the focus and defocus animations take care of any initial transform.

Works on iPhone and iPad.

> ### [SKBounceAnimation](https://github.com/khanlou/SKBounceAnimation)

SKBounceAnimation is a CAKeyframeAnimation subclass that creates an animation for you based on start and end values and a number of bounces. It’s based on the math and technology in this blogpost: khanlou.com/2012/01/cakeyframeanimation-make-it-bounce/ which in turn was based partially on Matt Gallagher’s work here: cocoawithlove.com/2008/09/parametric-acceleration-curves-in-core.html.


> ### [GCDObjC](https://github.com/mjmsmith/gcdobjc)

GCDObjC is an Objective-C wrapper for the most commonly used features of Grand Central Dispatch.  It has four main aims:

* Organize the flat C API into appropriate classes.
* Use intention-revealing names to distinguish between synchronous and asynchronous functions. 
* Use more convenient arguments such as time intervals.
* Add convenience methods.

**A Swift port is at [GCDSwift](https://github.com/mjmsmith/gcdswift).**
